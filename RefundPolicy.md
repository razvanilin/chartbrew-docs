# A fair refund policy.

Bad refund policies are infuriating. You feel like the company is just trying to rip you off. We never want our customers to feel that way, so our refund policy is simple: If you’re ever unhappy with our products* for any reason, just contact [our support team](mailto:support@chartbrew.com) and we'll take care of you.

## 30-Day money-back guarantee

If you tried one of our products and you weren’t happy with it, we're happy to refund the last payment if the refund request is made within 30 days of purchase, no questions asked. After 30 days, Depomo Ltd cannot issue refunds anymore, but you can cancel your subscription and are still able to use the service until the billing period ends.

## Partial refunds or credits we’d grant.

If we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month) or you emailed customer service and it took multiple days to get back to you, we’d issue a partial credit to your account.

## Policy updates

Depomo Ltd. reserves the right to modify or update this Policy at any time, without prior notice, by posting the revised version on our website or within the company's applications. Any changes made to this Policy will become effective immediately upon posting. It is your responsibility to review this Policy periodically to stay informed of any updates.

## Get in touch

[Send us a note](mailto:support@chartbrew.com), tell us what's up, and we'll work with you to make sure you’re happy.

**This policy applies to any product created and owned by Depomo Ltd. That includes Chartbrew.*

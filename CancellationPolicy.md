# Cancellation policy

*Last updated: Nov 16, 2022*

We want satisfied customers, not hostages. That’s why we make it easy for you to cancel your account directly in all of our apps — no phone calls required, no questions asked.

Account owners can follow these instructions to cancel in-app:
* Chartbrew: Log in and head over to [https://app.chartbrew.com/user?goto=account](https://app.chartbrew.com/user?goto=account) and click on the "Cancel Subscription" button.

Our legal responsibility is to account owners, which means we cannot cancel an account at the request of anyone else. If for whatever reason you no longer know who the account owner is, [contact us](mailto:support@chartbrew.com). We will gladly reach out to any current account owners at the email addresses we have on file.

## What happens when you cancel an account?

If you have an ongoing subscription, it will continue until the end of the billing period. After that, your account will be downgraded to a free and restricted account. If you have any paid add-ons, they will be removed from your account. Your account will not be charged again.

You also have an option to delete your account and any data associated with it. If you choose to delete your account the data is deleted immediately and cannot be recovered.

We believe in fair use and will treat you right if you got billed in error or you did not wish to continue your subscription after your trial ended. [Contact us](mailto:support@chartbrew.com) for a [fair refund](https://github.com/razvanilin/chartbrew-docs/blob/master/RefundPolicy.md). We’ll treat you right.

## Depomo-initiated cancellations

We may cancel accounts if they have been inactive for an extended period:
* For frozen accounts: 180 days after being frozen due to billing failures
* For free accounts: after 365 days of inactivity

We also retain the right to suspend or terminate accounts for any reason at any time, as outlined in our [Terms of Service](https://github.com/razvanilin/chartbrew-docs/blob/master/TermsAndConditions.md). In practice, this generally means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are using our products to engage in [abusive behavior](https://github.com/razvanilin/chartbrew-docs/blob/master/UseRestrictions.md).
